# lego-linear-regression
Samantha is a Lego enthusiast who wishes to expand her Lego collection as much as possible. She wants to be able to predict the price of a new Lego product before it is revealed in order to budget it from her revenue. A simple linear regression model was built based on number of pieces in a Lego set to predict Lego product prices for Samantha.
