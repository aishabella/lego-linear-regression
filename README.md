# lego-linear-regression
Scenario:
Samantha is a Lego enthusiast who wishes to expand her Lego collection as much as possible. She wants to be able to predict the price of a new Lego product before it is revealed in order to budget it from her revenue. A simple linear regression model was built based on number of pieces in a Lego set to predict Lego product prices for Samantha. 

The lego dataset used can be viewed as a .csv file in the project repository. Here is a breakdown of the column names and what they mean:
- ages - the age group the Lego product caters to
- list-price - the price of the lego product
- num_reviews - the number of reviews
- piece_count - number of lego pieces in the product
- play_stay_rating - rating by players at Playstar (0 to 5)
- review_difficulty - the difficulty level of the product
- star_rating - general rating for the product
- theme_name - Theme ID
- val_star_rating - another source of rating for the same products
- country - number of countries the product is sold in

A seven-phased data science life cycle was implemented for the process of handling the data for a prediction model and is as follows:
1. Business Understanding 
2. Discovery
3. Data Preparation
4. Data Modelling
5. Model Building
6. Evaluation
7. Results
  
(All data and scenario was obtained from Swinburne University 2022)
